Budgets
- Respect `performanceBudget.json`; keep route TTI reasonable.

Rendering
- Avoid expensive work in render paths; memoize selectors and components where needed.
- Debounce high-frequency events; prefer requestAnimationFrame for visual updates.

Logging
- Use structured logs via utilities in `src/lib/utils/logger`.
- Do not log PII or secrets; gate debug logs behind dev checks.
