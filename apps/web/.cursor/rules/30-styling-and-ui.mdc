Tailwind
- Prefer utility-first with small composition helpers (e.g., `cn`).
- Keep class strings readable; group by layout → spacing → color → effects.

Design system
- Reuse shared UI components from `src/components/ui/*` where possible.
- Avoid inline styles unless dynamic and minimal; otherwise extract to component API.
