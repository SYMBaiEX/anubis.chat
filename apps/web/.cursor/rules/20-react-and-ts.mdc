Components
- Use functional components with typed props. Export prop types from `.types.ts`.
- Prefer early-returns to reduce nesting. Avoid deep prop drilling; add context or hooks.
- Use camelCase for variables, props, and hook names; PascalCase for components; keep JSON wire formats mapped at boundaries.

State & effects
- Keep effects pure; add complete dependency arrays; extract async work.
- Memoize heavy calculations; avoid re-renders by stabilizing callback identities.

Error boundaries
- Provide user-facing error states; avoid silent failures.
