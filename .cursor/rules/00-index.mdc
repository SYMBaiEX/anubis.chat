description: Project-wide guidance index. Explains how rules attach and links to scoped rules. Keep under 500 lines.
when: always
globs: ["**/*"]
tags: ["index", "governance", "anubis-chat"]

Purpose
- Establish consistent, high-signal rules for this repo.
- Use auto-attach to keep relevant guidance near the code being edited.

Attachment modes
- always: included in every context.
- auto: included when edited files match `globs`.
- mention: included when explicitly cited or semantically related.

Core rule set
@./10-repository-standards.mdc
@./20-code-style-and-quality.mdc
@./30-security-and-secrets.mdc
@./40-dependency-management.mdc
@./50-mcp-and-tools.mdc

App-specific rule sets
- apps/web rules auto-attach when working inside `apps/web/**`.
@../../apps/web/.cursor/rules/00-index.mdc

Notes
- Prefer small, composable rules (<500 lines) over monoliths.
- Examples should be realistic and copy-pasteable.
- Use `@relative/path.mdc` to compose rules semantically.
