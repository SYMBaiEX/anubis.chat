MCP policy
- Prefer official documentation MCPs (Context7) for up-to-date APIs.
- Cite tool outputs concisely; avoid leaking secrets from env.

Context7 usage
- Resolve library ID before fetching docs.
- Scope topics (e.g., "Next.js app router routing").

Operational safety
- Non-interactive flags for CLI; avoid long-running foreground jobs.
