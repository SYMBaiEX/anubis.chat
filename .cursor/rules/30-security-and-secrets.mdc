Secrets
- Never commit secrets. Use environment variables; validate presence at runtime.
- Treat `.env*` as untrusted in code review; ensure `.gitignore` covers them.

Data handling
- Avoid logging PII. Redact tokens and wallet addresses when possible.
- Validate and sanitize all inputs crossing trust boundaries.

Dependencies
- Pin versions; avoid `^`/`~` in production packages.
- Run `npm audit` and address high severity promptly.
