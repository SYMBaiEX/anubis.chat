TypeScript
- Prefer explicit function signatures for exported members; avoid `any`.
- Use guard clauses and early returns. Avoid deep nesting.
- Never catch errors without meaningful handling.

Formatting
- Match existing formatting; avoid unrelated reformatting in edits.
- Prefer multi-line clarity over clever one-liners.

Testing
- Co-locate tests as `*.test.ts` or `*.spec.ts`.
- Mock only boundaries; verify behavior, not implementation details.

Performance & UX
- Avoid unnecessary renders; memoize expensive selectors.
- Prefer async/await over promise chains.
