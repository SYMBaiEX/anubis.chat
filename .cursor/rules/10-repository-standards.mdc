Structure
- Keep files â‰¤ 500 lines; extract shared logic into `packages/*` or `src/lib/*`.
- Co-locate components with types and styles (see web rules for specifics).

Naming
- Prefer camelCase for variables, functions, and object keys.
- Files: camelCase where supported in imports (e.g., `userProfile.ts`); keep route segments kebab-case if required by framework constraints.
- Components/dirs: PascalCase (e.g., `UserCard/`).
- Constants: SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE.

Git hygiene
- Conventional Commits: `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`, `test:`, `chore:`.
- Small, reviewable PRs; include BEFORE/AFTER screenshots when UI changes.

CI expectations
- No new linter or type errors. Use Bun scripts for all tasks (see CI rules).
